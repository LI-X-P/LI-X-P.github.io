Deep Learning is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation and bioinformatics where they produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts. Through this course, we will learn deep learning from basic concepts to high-level techniques, and apply deep learning techniques to resolve practical problems.
